# To Queue or not to Queue?
## That should not be a question

**No one likes to stand in line¬π.** Most people hate to waste their time queuing up. We spend an average of [6 months](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fascinating-facts-about-how-we-spend-the-days-410973) of our adult lives waiting our [turn](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3269123/How-time-spending-line-Infographic-reveals-hours-wasted-queuing-world-s-popular-tourist-attractions-s-Rome-patience-needed.html) ‚Äî almost 3 days a year. There are [books](https://www.amazon.com/Does-Other-Line-Always-Faster/dp/0761181229) about queues. [Documentaries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7663984/)¬≤. Even [academic experts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CBD2z51u5c) in queues. But then, when we are coding, we often forget to use `queues` and end up messing around with `lists` instead.

#### FIFO or LIFO1!!!

A [queue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPxBKxU8GIQ) in a supermarket is **FIFO.** The way we usually [stack boxes](https://media.giphy.com/media/8RH4MrJPTnVRK/giphy.gif) is **LIFO.** **FIFO** stands for *‚ÄúFirst In, First Out‚Äù¬≥.* **LIFO** is the acronym for *‚ÄúLast In, First Out‚Äù.* That‚Äôs it.

<span class="figcaption_hack">I used [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to draw this diagram. Awesome tool!</span>

> When implementing **FIFO** queues we usually use `add`, `peek` (returns, but does not remove, the head of the queue) and `poll` (returns and removes the head of the queue) methods, while we refer to them, respectively, as `push`, `peek` and `pop` in **LIFO **stacks.

#### The STACK, the QUEUE and the DEQUE

In a `stack` we can only add and remove elements from one end (**LIFO**), in a `queue` we add elements to one end and remove them from the other (**FIFO**) and, joining those two worlds we have the `deque` (aka *‚ÄúDouble Ended Queue‚Äù*) where we can add and remove elements from both ends. **None of them allows random access to the elements.**

> In JAVA you *should* use `deque` to model a `stack` because the Stack class [is considered obsolete](https://keithwilliamstechblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/13/why-the-java-stack-class-is-bad/) (it extends the Vector class and inherits all its methods, making it possible to break the **LIFO** principle).
